# Explore US Bikeshare Data
Udacity Professional Data Analyst Degree - Project

# Project Overview:
In this project, I will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I  will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
